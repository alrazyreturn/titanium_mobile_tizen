summary: Interface to represent Bluetooth Class of Device/Service(CoD). 
description: |
    Bluetooth device class describes the characteristics and capabilities of a device.

    Bluetooth CoD is a 24 bit integer created by the union of three components:

        Exactly one Major Device Class(bits 8-12 of CoD) - This is the highest level of granularity for defining a Bluetooth Device.
        Exactly one Minor Device Class(bits 2-7 of CoD) - This is to be interpreted only in the context of the Major Device Class. Thus, the meaning of these bits may change, depending on the value of 'Major Device Class'.
        Zero or more Major Service Classes(bits 13-23) - Represents the services supported by the device.

    The major and minor classes are intended to define a general family of devices with which any particular implementation wishes to be associated. No assumptions should be made about specific functionality or characteristics of any application, based solely on the assignment of a major or minor device class.
