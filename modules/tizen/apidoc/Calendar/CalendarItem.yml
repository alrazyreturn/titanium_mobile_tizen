        Includes a UID and a possible recurrence ID that is needed to identify a particular instance of a recurring event.
    type: CalendarItemId
    permission: read-only

  - name: lastModificationDate
    summary: |
        An attribute to identify the last modified date and time of an item.
        This attribute is automatically populated and cannot be edited by the client.
        (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.7.3).
    type: Date
    permission: read-only
    optional: true
    
  - name: description 
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the textual descriptions of an item.
        It is usually used to provide a more complete description of the item and any supporting information than what is provided in the summary attribute. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.5).
        
        The default value is an empty string.
    type: STRING
    
  - name: summary
    summary: |
        An attribute to store a short summary or subject for an item. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.12)
        
        The default value is an empty string.

  - name: isAllDay
    summary: |
        An attribute that behaves like a flag to indicate whether an event is an all-day event or not.
        If set to true, then the time and time zone of the startDate are to be ignored and are not guaranteed to be stored in the database. An all-day event always covers the whole day, regardless of which time zone it was defined in and what the current time zone is. The duration must be n*60*24 minutes for an event lasting n days.
        
        The default value for this attribute is false.
    type: Boolean

  - name: startDate 
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the start date/time for an item. (see RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.2.4).
        The default value for this attribute is null.
        
        startDate must be specified in the same time zone as endDate / dueDate if provided.
    type: Date

  - name: duration
    summary: |
        An attribute to denote the duration of the calendar component. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.2.5).
        By default, this attribute is set to null.
        
        duration and endDate / dueDate are mutually exclusive, hence, only one of them have null.
        
        Be rounded to second.
    type: Number

  - name: location 
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the location or the intended venue for the activity defined by the calendar item. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.7)
        
        The default value for this attribute is an empty string.
    type: String
    
  - name: geolocation

    summary: |
        An attribute to store the name of the person who organized this event. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.4.3).
        By default, this attribute is initialized to an empty string.
    type: STRING

  - name: visibility
    summary: |
        An attribute to mark the visibility (secrecy) level of the item. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.3).
        The value is one of the constants defined for this parameter : CALENDAR_ITEM_VISIBILITY_PUBLIC = 'PUBLIC',
        CALENDAR_ITEM_VISIBILITY_PRIVATE = 'PRIVATE', ...
        The default value is CALENDAR_ITEM_VISIBILITY_PUBLIC.
    type: STRING

  - name: status
    summary: |
        An attribute to store the overall confirmation status for a calendar component. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.11).
        For an event, the default value is CALENDAR_ITEM_STATUS_CONFIRMED = 'CONFIRMED'. 
        For a task, the default value is CALENDAR_ITEM_STATUS_NEEDS_ACTION = 'NEEDS_ACTION'.
    type: STRING

  - name: priority
    summary: |
        An attribute to indicate the priority level of an item and may be used to relatively prioritize multiple items during a given period of time. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.9).
        The default value for this attribute is <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CALENDAR_ITEM_PRIORITY_LOW> priority.

        If the native item database supports another priority schema (such as a range from 1 to 9), the implementation must convert those values to the supported values. 
        For instance, RFC 5545 suggests the following mapping for a range from 1 to 9:

            - 1-4 to <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CALENDAR_ITEM_PRIORITY_HIGH>,
            - 5 to <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CALENDAR_ITEM_PRIORITY_MEDIUM>,
            - 6-9 to <Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CALENDAR_ITEM_PRIORITY_LOW>.

  - name: categories
    summary: |
        An attribute to indicate the item categories or subtypes of a calendar component. 
        The categories are useful in searching for a calendar component of a particular type and category. 
        (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.1.2).  
        
        Examples of categories are personal, work, vacation, travel, etc.
        By default, this attribute is set to an empty array.
    type: Array<String>

  - name: attendees
    summary: |
        An attribute array that lists the people attending an event. (See RFC 5545 - Section 3.8.4.3).
        By default, this attribute is set to an empty array.
    type: Array<Modules.Tizen.Calendar.CalendarAttendee>
