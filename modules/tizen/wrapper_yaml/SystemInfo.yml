name: Modules.Tizen.SystemInfo
summary: This Module provides  interfaces and methods providing web applications with access to various properties of the system.
description: |
    This API also provides interfaces and methods for users to get hardware devices status, to get the value of selected properties, and to set up asynchronous notifications of changes for selected values. The following provides an overview of the tree data structure:
    BATTERY
    CPU
    STORAGE
    DISPLAY
    DEVICE_ORIENTATION
    BUILD
    NETWORK
    WIFI_NETWORK
    CELLULAR_NETWORK
    SIM
    
    The `SystemInfo` module is a thin wrapper on the Tizen `SystemInfo` class.

methods:
  - name: getCapabilities
    summary: Retrieves the capabilities of the device.
    description: |
        The function must synchronously acquire the capabilities of the device.
        
        To use this function, it is required to include the following privilege in the tiapp.xml file of your Titanium application: http://tizen.org/privilege/systeminfo
    returns:
        type: Modules.Tizen.SystemInfo.SystemInfoDeviceCapability
    examples:
      - example: |
            var tizen = require("tizen");

            }
            
  - name: getPropertyValue
    summary: Retrieves the current state of a given system property.
    description: |
        The function must asynchronously acquire the current state of the requested property. 
        If it is successful, the successCallback must be invoked with an object containing 
        the information provided by the property.
        
        The errorCallback is launched with these error types:
            - NotFoundError: If the property is not recognized.
            - InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contain an invalid value.
            - UnknownError: In any other error case.
        
        To use this function, it is required to include the following privilege in the tiapp.xml file of your Titanium application: http://tizen.org/privilege/systeminfo
    parameters:
      - name: property 
        summary: Name of the property to retrieve.
        type: String
      - name: successCallback
        summary: Function called when the properties have been successfully retrieved.
        type: Callback<Modules.Tizen.SystemInfo.SystemInfoProperty>
      - name: errorCallback
        summary: Function called when an error occurred while retrieving the properties.
        type: Callback<Modules.Tizen.WebAPIError>
        optional: true
    examples:
      - example: |
            var tizen = require("tizen");
            
            function onSuccessCallback(battery) {
                Titanium.API.info("The battery level is " + battery.level);
            }
            
            function onErrorCallback(error) {
                Titanium.API.info("An error occurred " + error.message);
            }
        
            tizen.SystemInfo.getPropertyValue(tizen.SystemInfo.SYSTEM_INFO_PROPERTY_ID_BATTERY, onSuccessCallback, onErrorCallback );
        
  - name: addPropertyValueChangeListener
    summary: Allows tracking the change of one or several system properties.
    description: |
        When called, it immediately returns and then asynchronously starts a watch process defined as this set of steps:
        1. Acquire the system's current values for the property requested. If successful, it invokes the associated successCallback, 
           passing the resulting property value. The type of the passed object is indicated by the property's value type in the definitions below. For example,
           if you are passing <Modules.Tizen.SystemInfo.SYSTEM_INFO_PROPERTY_ID_BATTERY> for SystemInfoPropertyId, you'll get SystemInfoBattery object.
        2. Register the successCallback to receive system events that the status of the requested properties may have changed.
        3. When a system event is successfully received invoke the associated successCallback with an object containing the property values.
        4. Repeat step 3 until removePropertyValueChangeListener function is called.
        
        To use this function, it is required to include the following privilege in the tiapp.xml file of your Titanium application: http://tizen.org/privilege/systeminfo
    returns:
        summary: Identifier used to clear the watch subscription.
        type: Number

            }
            
            tizen.SystemInfo.addPropertyValueChangeListener(tizen.SystemInfo.SYSTEM_INFO_PROPERTY_ID_BATTERY, onSuccessCallback, {lowThreshold : 0.2});
    
  - name: removePropertyValueChangeListener
    summary: |
        Unsubscribes notifications for property changes set up by addPropertyValueChangeListener.
    description: |
        If a valid listenerId argument is passed that corresponds to a subscription already place, 
        then the watch process MUST immediately terminate and no further callback is invoked. 
        If the listenerId argument does not correspond to a valid subscription, 
        the method should return without any further action.
        
        To use this function, it is required to include the following privilege in the tiapp.xml file of your Titanium application: http://tizen.org/privilege/systeminfo
    parameters:

               if (id != null) // After receiving the first notification, we clear it
                  tizen.SystemInfo.removePropertyValueChangeListener(id);
            }
            
            id = tizen.SystemInfo.addPropertyValueChangeListener(tizen.SystemInfo.SYSTEM_INFO_PROPERTY_ID_BATTERY, onSuccessCallback);
