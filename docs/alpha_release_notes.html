    <h1>Alpha stage of Titanium's Tizen extension project: release notes</h1><BR>
    <h2>The CLI build system</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Titanium SDK for Tizen was developed. It now allows building
        Tizen applications from Titanium sources.&nbsp;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The common command-line interface is supported. Please
          specify <b>--platform=tizen</b> where the target platform
          must be selected.</li>
        <li>Package signing using a test certificate is provided.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>A Titanium for Tizen SDK archive can be built, based on the
        source code of Titanium Mobile Web SDK, using a build script.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A step-by-step guide for building the Titanium Tizen SDK,
          and Tizen applications, is available <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/blob/master/docs/Environment%20Configuration%20and%20Running%20Samples%20on%20Tizen.docx">here</a>.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Titanium API</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Titanium API was ported to Tizen. <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is now possible to write realistic Titanium applications
          and run them on the Tizen operating system. This was verified
          by porting <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/samples/KitchenSink">Kitchen
            Sink</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/samples/Mapping">geolocation</a>
          samples, and authoring a <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/samples/ContactsSample">Contacts</a>
          sample.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The Tizen implementation of Titanium API is based on the
          Mobile Web implementation of Titanium API.</li>
        <li>Tizen device API was made directly available to Titanium
          developers. <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The "tizen" namespace, encompassing <a
href="https://developer.tizen.org/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.tizen.web.device.apireference%2Findex.html">Tizen
              device API</a>, can be referenced directly in Titanium
            code, and used if necessary. <br>
          </li>
          <li>As agreed during the project, no wrappers were added
            (although a script that transforms Tizen's WebIDL to
            Titanium-style skeleton namespaces was developed).<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Titanium applications were observed on both Tizen emulator
          and Tizen hardware device.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Parts of Titanium API could not be ported. A discussion on
          these cases can be found in <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/blob/master/docs/detailed%20status.xlsx">this
            spreadsheet</a>.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Titanium API was modified in several places to extend the
        available functionality. <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Where Tizen's device API was not present or sufficient, HTML5 was used to implement new features and
          APIs.</li>
        <li><a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/blob/master/docs/titanium.docx">This
            document</a> describes the new APIs and the new behaviors in
          detail. (It can be used by the authors of the Titanium API
          reference, who could use the information to update the
          information in a straightforward manner.)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Titanium API was tested on Tizen in the following ways:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Anvil:<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Anvil automated tests were <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/anvil">ported</a>
            to Tizen. All Anvil tests were executed.
          </li>
          <ul><li>A guide to running
            Anvil tests on Tizen can be found <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/blob/master/docs/Running%20Anvil%27s%20Driver%20for%20Tizen.docx">here</a>.<br>
          </li></ul>
          <li>Anvil issues pertaining to Tizen were fixed where
            possible.</li>
          <li>New simple, proof-of-concept Anvil tests were added for
            some Titanium APIs (UI.TableViewSection,
            UI.MobileWeb.NavigationGroup, UI.Slider, UI.AlertDialog,
            UI.ProgressBar, UI.OptionDialog, UI.ActivityIndicator,
            UI.Label). A means of more detailed testing, based on
            analyzing the actual screen appearance of UI widgets, was
            added for future use.<br>
          </li>
          <li>A script was developed that parses the Anvil source code and generates coarse statistics of Titanium API coverage.
          </li>
          <li>Not all Anvil tests currently succeed. Some failures are
            attributed to Tizen/Titanium bugs/limitations, but some
            issues still require investigation/fixing for the beta
            milestone.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Kitchen sink:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/samples/KitchenSink">Kitchen
              Sink</a> sample was ported, and studied in depth to find
            abnormalities on Tizen.</li>
          <li>Kitchen Sink behavior on Mobile Web and Android was taken
            as the base for comparison. I.e. missing or wrong behavior
            was detected by looking at the same code, running on Mobile
            Web and Android.<br>
          </li>
          <li>A number of modifications to both Kitchen Sink and
            Titanium APIs was made to fix the found discrepansies.
            Please refer to <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/blob/master/docs/detailed%20status.xlsx">this
              spreadsheet</a> for a list of fixes made with respect to
            the behavior of Kitchen Sink.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mobile web issues found during testing <a
href="https://jira.appcelerator.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=14433">were
            reported</a>. Some of them were fixed for Tizen, and the
          fixes may be incorporated back to Mobile Web when they meet
          the quality requirements.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Anvil tests <a
href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tizen/tree/master/tests/anvil/configSet/Resources/suites/tizen">were
          developed</a> for Tizen device API namespaces. <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>An internal document, describing the coverage of namespaces,
          methods, and properties of Tizen device API, is available upon
          request.</li>
        <li>Tizen issues that were found, were <a
href="https://bugs.tizen.org/jira/issues/?filter=10810&amp;jql=reporter%20in%20%28yaroslavp%29%20ORDER%20BY%20createdDate%20DESC">reported
            to Tizen</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>Titanium studio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As agreed with Appcelerator, Titanium studio user interface
        extensions pertaining to Tizen will be made by Appcelerator's
        Titanium studio team.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Command-line interface that will be called by these extensions
        was developed by GlobalLogic and is ready for use (see the CLI
        build system section). <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>GlobalLogic will be happy to support Appcelerator's
          developers in connecting the UI and the CLI, if needed.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Documentation and support<br>

    <ul>
      <li>The following <a
