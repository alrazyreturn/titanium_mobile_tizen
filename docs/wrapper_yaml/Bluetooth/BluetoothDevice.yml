name: Titanium.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothDevice
summary: The interface which represents a remote Bluetooth device.   
description: |
    This interface holds information about a remote device available on a local Bluetooth device, such as device name, address, bonding status, etc.
    A BluetoothDevice object can be retrieved using one of the following APIs:
        BluetoothAdapter.getDevice()
        BluetoothAdapter.getKnownDevices()
        BluetoothAdapter.discoverDevices()
        BluetoothAdapter.createBonding()

extends: Titanium.Module
platforms: [tizen]
methods:

  - name: connectToServiceByUUID
    summary: Creates a socket connection to the specified service UUID.
    description: |
        This method attempts to open a connection to the service identified by uuid on this remote device. This performs an SDP(Service Discovery Protocol) lookup on the local device for the given uuid and determines which channel to use.
        If opening a connection is successful, then a BluetoothSocket object with open state is sent using successCallback, through which data can be exchanged by both devices.
        The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:
            NotFoundError: If there is no service with the given uuid
            InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contain an invalid value.
            UnknownError: In any other error case

    parameters: 
      - name: uuid
        summary: 128 bit unique identifier, which represents the service record on the device.
        type: String

      - name: successCallback
        summary: Method to be invoked when the asynchronous call completes successfully. 
        type: Callback<Titanium.Tizen.Bluetooth.BluetoothSocket> 

      - name: errorCallback
        summary: Method to be invoked in case of failure to open a socket.
        type: Callback<Titanium.Tizen.WebAPIError>
        optional: true
