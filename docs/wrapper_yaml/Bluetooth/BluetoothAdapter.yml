    description: |
        That is, devices within proximity to the local device.
        This method initiates the device discovery process. When the discovery process has started successfully, BluetoothDiscoverDevicesSuccessCallback.onstarted() is invoked. If any device is found in the process, then the device information is sent with BluetoothDiscoverDevicesSuccessCallback.ondevicefound(). At the end of the discovery process, BluetoothDiscoverDevicesSuccessCallback.onfinished() is invoked. If a device goes out of proximity then BluetoothDiscoverDevicesSuccessCallback.ondevicedisappeared() is invoked with the address of the device. Note that if no device is found, BluetoothDiscoverDevicesSuccessCallback.ondevicefound() will never be called.
        The discovery process can be cancelled anytime, by calling stopDiscovery() on the BluetoothAdapter.
        The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:
            ServiceNotAvailableError: If a Bluetooth device is turned off.

  - name: registerRFCOMMServiceByUUID
    summary: Registers a service for other devices to consume.    
    description: |
        This method registers a service record in the device service record database with the specified uuid, name and auto assigned channel. On success of the service registration, it returns a BluetoothServiceHandler object as the first parameter of successCallback, and listens for client connections. The service handler can be used to be notified on client connections or to unregister the service. User interaction is mandatory to connect to a registered service and a link between devices is encrypted. This guarantees a registered service is securely protected.
        Clients should do service discovery on this device with a specified uuid to determine the right channel.
        If any client(remote device) connects to this service, then BluetoothServiceHandler.onconnect() is invoked with BluetoothSocket object.
        BluetoothServiceHandler.unregister() can be used to unregister the service record from the device service database and stop listening for client connections.
        The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:
            InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contain an invalid value.
            ServiceNotAvailableError: If a Bluetooth device is turned off.
            UnknownError: In any other error case.
