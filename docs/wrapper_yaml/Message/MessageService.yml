name: Titanium.Tizen.Message.MessageService
summary: Message creating, sending, and fetching capabilities. 
description: |
    This interface allows a web application to manipulate and send messages.
    The interface allows you to fetch messages for all folders belonging to one account, with synchronizable flag set, using the sync() method, or for a given folder using the syncFolder() method.
    The interface allows you to fetch the message body for a given message using loadMessageBody() method.

extends: Titanium.Module
platforms: [tizen]
methods:

  - name: sendMessage
    summary: Attempts to send the specified message. 
    description: |
        For messaging technologies in which the message is sent individually to every recipient, (such as SMS) individual notification MUST be supported as follows:
        For every individual recipient in the destination list, if the message cannot be sent to that recipient, the onerror method of the errorCallback argument MUST be invoked with the corresponding error type as input parameter. These error types may be passed, depending on the the error conditions:
            NetworkError: If the network connection is not accessible.
            InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contains an invalid value.
            UnknownError: In any other error case.
        The error message contains the name of the recipient who failed to receive the sent message.
        When the operation is fully completed (that is, the implementation has the result of the send operation for all recipients), the onsuccess(DOMString[] recipients) method of the successCallback will be invoked with an array of recipients who received the sent message, as input parameter.
    parameters: 
      - name: message
        summary: The message to be sent. 
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Message.Message

    summary: Attempts to load the body for the specified message. 
    description: |
        It is the back end's responsibility to detect which mime parts of the message are related to the message body and should be loaded. If the message body is already loaded, the onsuccess method of the successCallback will be invoked immediately.
        The errorCallback is launched with these error types:
            InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contains an invalid value.
            UnknownError: In any other error case.
