name: Titanium.Tizen.Time
summary: The Module provides information regarding date / time and time zones.
description: |
    The JavaScript Date object does not have full timezone support.
    
    Date objects allow only simple representations to denote a particular location's offset from Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
    This is typically provided as a +/- offset from UTC-0 (also known as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT) for example, +05:30 denotes 
    that a location is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC +00:00. The issue with this method is not getting the correct local 
    time for a given date. The existing methods are sufficient for this purpose. The issue is correctly converting to and from 
    local time and UTC for all points in time - in any of the past, present, and future - based on an initial time provided. 
    This is important for defining relative dates, where a time in a given location may observe different UTC offsets, 
    according to any Daylight Savings Rules (DST) in effect or any other changes that may occur to a location's time zone over time. 
    Without the communication of the explicit time zone rules governing a given date and time, the ability to effectively calculate 
    the offset of the local time to UTC or to any other time zone at any point in the past or future is lost.
    This API can be used to get TZDate objects with full timezone support, convert them between timezones, retrieve available timezones.

    The `Time` module is a thin wrapper on the Tizen `TimeUtil` class.	

extends: Titanium.Module
platforms: [tizen]

methods:
  - name: getCurrentDateTime
    summary: Returns the current date / time.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TZDate
    examples:
      - example: |
            var current_dt = Titanium.Tizen.Time.getCurrentDateTime();
            Titanium.API.info("current date / time is " + current_dt.toLocaleString());

  - name: getLocalTimezone
    summary: Returns identifier of the local system timezone.
    returns:
        type: String
    examples:
      - example: |
            Titanium.API.info("The local time zone is " + Titanium.Tizen.Time.getLocalTimezone());
        
  - name: getAvailableTimezones
    summary: Returns synchronously the identifiers of the timezones supported by the device.
    description: | 
        Zero or more slashes separate different components of a timezone identifier, 
        with the most general descriptor first and the most specific one last. 
        
        For example, 'Europe/Berlin', 'America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires'.
    returns:
        type: String[]
    examples:
      - example: |
            var tzids = Titanium.Tizen.Time.getAvailableTimezones();
            Titanium.API.info("The device supports " + tzids.length + " time zones.");
