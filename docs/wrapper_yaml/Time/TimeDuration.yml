  - title: Simple code example
    example:    |
        var d1 = new tizen.TimeDuration(1, "HOURS"); // 1 hour
        var d2 = new tizen.TimeDuration(120, "MINS"); // 120 minutes
        var ret = d1.lessThan(d2); // Returns true
        
        var now = tizen.time.getCurrentDateTime();
        var tomorrow = now.addDuration(new tizen.TimeDuration(1, "DAYS")); // Becomes tomorrow, same time.
   
methods:

  - name: difference
    summary: Calculates the difference between two TimeDuration objects.
    description: |
        Calculates the difference in time between this and other. 
        The TimeDuration that is returned is effectively first - other (that is: positive if the first parameter is larger).
        The returned TimeDuration is the biggest possible unit without losing the precision.
    returns:
        summary: New TimeDuration object corresponding to the result of this - other.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    parameters:    
      - name: other
        summary:  Other <Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration> object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration

  - name: equalsTo
    summary: Checks if the TimeDuration is equal to another.
    description: |
        This method takes the units into consideration and will return true if the two TimeDuration objects represent the same duration in different units.
    returns:
        summary:

        summary: True if the TimeDuration is less than other.
        type: Boolean
    parameters:
      - name: other
        summary: Other TimeDuration object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration

  - name: greaterThan
    summary: Checks if the TimeDuration is greater than another.
    description: This method takes the units into consideration when doing the comparison.
        
    returns:
        summary: True if the TimeDuration is greater than other.
        type: Boolean

        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration

properties:

  - name: length
    summary: |
        Duration length.

    type: Number
    
  - name: unit
    summary: |
        Duration unit (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days).
