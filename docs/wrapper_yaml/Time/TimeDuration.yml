name: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
summary: The TimeDuration object that contains the length and its associated time unit.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
platforms: [tizen]
since: "3.0.2"

examples: 
  - title: Simple code example
    example:    |
        var now = Ti.Tizen.Time.getCurrentDateTime();
        var tomorrow = now.addDuration(Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 1, unit: "DAYS"})); // Becomes tomorrow, same time.
   
methods:

  - name: difference
    summary: Calculates the difference between two TimeDuration objects.
    description: |
        Calculates the difference in time between this and other. 
        The TimeDuration that is returned is effectively first - other (that is: positive if the first parameter is larger).
        The returned TimeDuration is the biggest possible unit without losing the precision.
    returns:
        summary: New TimeDuration object corresponding to the result of this - other.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    parameters:    
      - name: other
        summary:  Other <Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration> object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    examples:
        example: |
             // Compute event1.duration - event2.duration
             var diff = event1.duration.difference(event2.duration);
             if (diff.length > 0)
               Ti.API.info("event 1's duration is longer than event 2's");
             else if (diff.length == 0)
               Ti.API.info("event 1's duration is as long as event 2's");
             else
               Ti.API.info("event 1's duration is shorter than event 2's");

  - name: equalsTo
    summary: Checks if the TimeDuration is equal to another.
    description: |
        This method takes the units into consideration and will return true if the two TimeDuration objects represent the same duration in different units.
    returns:
        summary: 
        type: Number
    parameters:
      - name: other
        summary:  TimeDuration object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    examples:
        example: |
            var d1 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 60, unit: "MINS"}); // 60 minutes
            var d2 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 1, unit: "HOURS"}); // 1 hour
            var ret = d1.equalsTo(d2); // Returns true

  - name: lessThan
    summary: Checks if the TimeDuration is lower than another.
    description: This method takes the units into consideration when doing the comparison.
        
    returns:
        summary: True if the TimeDuration is less than other.
        type: Boolean
    parameters:
      - name: other
        summary: Other TimeDuration object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    examples:
        example: |
             var d1 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 1, unit: "HOURS"}); // 1 hour
             var d2 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 120, unit: "MINS"}); // 120 minutes
             var ret = d1.lessThan(d2); // Returns true

  - name: greaterThan
    summary: Checks if the TimeDuration is greater than another.
    description: This method takes the units into consideration when doing the comparison.
        
    returns:
        summary: True if the TimeDuration is greater than other.
        type: Boolean
    parameters:
      - name: other
        summary:  Other TimeDuration object to compare to.
        type: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TimeDuration
    examples:
        example: |
            var d1 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 120, unit: "MINS"}); // 120 minutes
            var d2 = Ti.Tizen.Time.createTimeDuration({length: 1, unit: "HOURS"}); // 1 hour
            var ret = d1.greaterThan(d2); // Returns true

properties:

  - name: length
    summary: |
        Duration length.
        The unit of the duration length (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days) is determined by the duration unit attribute.
    type: Number
    
  - name: unit
    summary: |
        Duration unit (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days).
        The default value is "MSECS" (milliseconds unit).
    type: String
    default: Titanium.Tizen.Time.TIME_DURATION_UNIT_MSECS
