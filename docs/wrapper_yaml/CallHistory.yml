summary: The top level CallHistory module.  
description: |
    This API provides interfaces and methods for retrieving information from the call history.

    For more information on the CallHistory features, see [Tizen Web App Programming: Call History](https://developer.tizen.org/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.tizen.web.appprogramming%2Fhtml%2Fguide%2Fsocial_guide%2Fcall.htm)
extends: Titanium.Module
platforms: [tizen]

methods:
  - name: find
    summary: Finds and returns call history items.
    description: |
        To use this method, it is required to include the following privilege in the tiapp.xml file of your Titanium application: http://tizen.org/privilege/callhistory.read
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: This is a callback interface of CallHistory operations. For example code see CallHistory interface.
        type: Callback<CallHistoryFindResponse>
      - name: filter
        summary: A filter defined on CallHistoryEntry attributes. It can be a composite filter.
        description: |
            AbstractFilter is a common interface used by different types of object filters. 
            Never use this base interface directly, instead use AbstractFilter subtypes, such as AttributeFilter, AttributeRangeFilter, and CompositeFilter. 
        optional: true
        type: Tizen.AbstractFilter
      - name: sortMode
        summary: The sorting order preference of the result set.
        optional: true
        type: Tizen.SortMode
      - name: limit
        summary: The maximum limits the query result is set to as specified by the parameter (It is the same meaning as SQL LIMIT). If 0, there is no limit set.
        optional: true
        type: Number
      - name: offset
        summary: The offset in the result set, from where the results are listed (It is the same semantics as SQL OFFSET). The number of results listed is maximum the specified limit parameter. Defaults to 0, meaning no offset.
        optional: true
        type: Number
