summary: This Module provides  provides access to a device's filesystem.
description: |
    The filesystem is represented as an abstract collection of disjointed filesystem virtual root locations,
    each corresponding to a specific location in the device filesystem. The filesystem API exposes the hierarchies
    below these root locations as a single virtual filesystem, but provides no access to other parts of the device filesystem.

    Each virtual root has a string name. Each file or directory within the virtual filesystem is addressed using a fully-qualified path of the form:
    <root name>/<path> where <rootname> is the name of the virtual root and <path> is the path to the file or directory relative to that root.

    The following virtual roots MUST be supported:
        - images: the images location
        - videos: the videos location
        - music: the sounds location
        - documents: the documents location
        - downloads: the location for downloaded items
        - wgt-package: the widget package location (read-only location)
        - wgt-private: the widget private storage
        - wgt-private-tmp: the widget private volatile storage area
    To access specific locations from those specified above, a file handle must be retrieved using the filesystem.resolve call.

    A file handle represents either a file or a directory. For a file, the isFile attribute is true.
    For a directory, the isDirectory attribute is true. A file can be opened for read and write operations, using a FileStream handle.
    A list of files and sub-directories can be obtained from a directory and a resolve method exists to resolve files or sub-directories
    more conveniently than processing directory listings.

    The implementation MUST support the use of the following characters in file names:
        - Letters (azAZ)
        - Numbers (0-9)
        - Blank spaces
        - Underscores ("_")
        - Hyphens ("-")
        - Periods (".")

    The implementation MAY support additional characters in file names, depending on platform support.
    The implementation MAY forbid the use of additional characters in file names, depending on the platform.
    The use of the path separator "/" in file names MUST NOT be allowed. The "/" character is used as the (path) component separator.

    Some other file name and path characteristics are platform-dependent, for example, maximum path length, file name length,
    case sensitivity, additional character support, etc. Therefore, it is recommended that you avoid any dependency on aspects
    that cannot be supported across many platforms.

    When a path is used to interact with the underlying filesystem, the encoding used for the file path SHOULD be the platform default.

    The `Filesystem` module is a thin wrapper on the Tizen `FileSystemManager` class.

    example: |
        var documentsDir,
            tizen = require("tizen");
        
        function onsuccess(files) {

methods:
  - name: resolve
    summary: Resolves a location to a file handle.
    description: |
        It validates and resolves the given location to a file handle. If the operation completes successfully, the handle is returned in the FileSuccessCallback. A valid location is prefixed with a valid root or default location and must address an existing, accessible file or directory.
        The list of root locations that MUST be supported by a compliant implementation are:
            - documents: Describes the default folder in which text documents (such as pdf, doc...) are stored by default in the device. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Documents" folder.
            - images: Describes the default folder in which still images, like pictures (such as jpg, gif, png, etc.), are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Images" folder.
            - music: Describes the default folder in which sound clips (such as mp3, aac, etc.) are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Music" folder.
            - videos: Describes the default folder in which video clips (such as avi, mp4, etc.) are stored in the device by default. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "My Videos" folder.
            - downloads: Describes the default folder in which files downloaded (such as by a browser, e-mail client, etc.) are stored by default in the device. For example, in some platforms it corresponds to the "Downloads" folder.
            - wgt-package: Describes the read-only folder in which the content of the widget file was extracted to.
            - wgt-private: Describes a private folder in which a widget can store information. This folder MUST be accessible only to the widget. Other widgets or applications MUST NOT access the information stored there.
            - wgt-private-tmp: Describes a temporary, private folder in which a widget can store data that is available during one widget execution cycle. Content of this folder MAY be removed from this directory when the widget is closed or the Web Runtime is restarted. This folder MUST be accessible only to the widget. Other widgets or applications MUST NOT have access to it.

        The mode parameter specifies whether the resulting File object has read-only access (<Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_R> access),
        read and write access (<Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_RW> access), append access (<Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_A> access), or write access (<Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_W> access) to the root location containing directory tree.
        Permission for the requested access is obtained from the security framework.
        Once the resulting File object has access, access is inherited by any other File objects derived
        from this instance without any further reference to the security framework, as noted in descriptions of certain methods of File.

        The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:
            - InvalidValuesError: If any of the input parameters contain an invalid value. For example, the mode is not valid (that is not <Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_R>, <Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_RW>, <Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_A>, or <Tizen.Filesystem.FILE_MODE_W>).
            - NotFoundError: The location input argument does not correspond to a valid location.
            - UnknownError: In any other error case.
    parameters:
      - name: location
        summary: Location to resolve. Must be a virtual path, prefixed by a valid root.
        type: String
      - name: onsuccess

        The ErrorCallback is launched with these error types:

  - name: addStorageStateChangeListener
    summary: Subscribes to notifications when a storage state changes.
    description: |
        The most common usage for this method would be to watch notifications of additions and removals of external storages.

        When executed, the implementation MUST immediately return a subscription identifier that identifies the watch operation.
        After returning the identifier, the watch operation is started asynchronously. The onsuccess MUST be invoked every time a storage state changes.
        If the attempt fails, the onerror (if present) MUST be invoked with the relevant error type.

        The watch operation MUST continue until the removeStorageStateChangeListener() method is called with the corresponding subscription
    returns:
        summary: The identifier used to clear the watch subscription.
        type: Number
    parameters:
      - name: onsuccess
        summary: To be invoked in every change on storage state.
        type: Callback<Tizen.Filesystem.FileSystemStorage>

        summary: To be invoked in case of error during the watch process.
        type: Callback<Tizen.WebAPIError>

                    Titanium.API.info("Storage " + storage.label + " was added!");
                }

            watchID = tizen.Filesystem.addStorageStateChangeListener(onStorageStateChanged);
  - name: removeStorageStateChangeListener
    summary: Unsubscribes a storage watch operation.
    description: |
        If the watchId argument is valid and corresponds to a subscription already in place,
        the watch process MUST immediately stop and no further callbacks MUST be invoked.
    parameters:
      - name: watchId
        summary:  Subscription Identifier.
