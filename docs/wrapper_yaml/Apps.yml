  - name: launchAppControl
    summary: Launches an application with the specified application control. 
    description: |
        An application can launch other applications with the application control, and get back the results from the launched applications.
        The application control consists of an operation, URI, and MIME type, and describes the request to be performed by the newly launched application. The application control is passed to the launchAppControl() method to launch an application. The system tries to find the proper application to perform the requested application control, then launches the selected application.
        The application control request is passed to the newly launched application and it can be accessed by getRequestedAppControl() method. The passed application control contains the reason the application was launched and information about what the application is doing. The launched application can send a result to the caller application with the replyResult() method of RequestedApplicationControl interface.
